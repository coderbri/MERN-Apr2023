Show App - DevLog

1.1.0
- starting D16 lecture-code
- New component added:`EditShowForm.jsx` . In this component, “Edit” buttons will now route to this form page, which looks similar to the `CreateShowForm` component, but will pre-populate existing show data in form inputs to update.
- To best perform error handling, `.catch()` ==in the controller== responses are best written as:
  ```js
  .catch( error => response.status(400).json(error) );
  ```
  Based on previous testing, if it is not set up like this, frontend validations fail to show up nor does it validate if the form is correctly inputed.

- A utility component was added to enable consistent date formatting—`dateUtils.js`.
  ```jsx
    export const formatDate = ( timestamp ) => {
        const options = {
    	    year: 'numeric',
        	month: 'short',
            day: 'numeric',
    	    hour: 'numeric',
    	    minute: 'numeric',
            hour12: true
    	}
        const formattedDate = new Date(timestamp).toLocaleDateString( 'en-US', options );
    	return formattedDate;
    }
  ```
  Now, when timestamps are presented, they will appear as the following: **Jan 1, 2024, 2:23PM**.
