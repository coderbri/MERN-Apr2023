## Frontend Handling (`CreateShowForm.jsx` component)

### Backend: Controller Adjustment (`createShow` function)
The adjustments made in the `createShow` function of the controller, along with the corresponding handling in the `CreateShowForm.jsx` component, are effective for several reasons:

```js
createShow: (request, response) => {
    Show.create(request.body)
        .then((newShow) => {
            console.log("\n=== New show added! ===\n" + newShow);
            response.json({ show: newShow });
        })
        .catch(error => response.status(400).json(error));
},
```

1. **Backend Error Handling:**
   - The `.catch` block provides detailed error information (`error.response.data.errors`) in case of an error during the creation of a new show.
   - This detailed error response aids in development and debugging by providing insights into what went wrong.


    ```javascript
    axios.post('http://localhost:8000/api/show/new', show)
        .then((response) => {
            console.log(response);
            navigate('/');
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.log(error);
            setErrors(error.response.data.errors);
        });
    ```

2. **Frontend Error Handling:**
   - In the `.catch` block of the frontend, errors returned from the backend are logged, and the `setErrors` function is used to update the `errors` state in the component.
   - The `errors` state is then utilized to display specific error messages next to the corresponding form fields.

3. **User-Friendly Display:**
   - The error messages are displayed to the user in a user-friendly manner, providing feedback on what fields have errors and what the specific issues are.

4. **Redirect After Successful Submission:**
   - After a successful submission (`.then` block), the `navigate('/')` function from `react-router-dom` is used to redirect the user to the home page.
   - This helps in maintaining a smooth user flow and avoids potential confusion if the user stays on the form page after a successful submission.

Overall, these adjustments enhance the development experience by providing detailed error feedback during development and a user-friendly display of errors for users interacting with the form. Additionally, the redirect ensures a better user experience after a successful submission.
